                <h3>King of Iron Fist Tournament 8
                <h1>I have to enter my eighth tournament in a row</h1>

                <p>
                    Another year another King of Iron Fist tournament. I
                    had no plans of entering this year, but life had other plans,
                    I seriously feel like I'm just stuck doing these things. 
                    I win a tournament, use the money to open an orphanage, and
                    for like 7 years I just kept doing it. Why are there so many
                    new orphans all the time? Well <i>maybe</i> it's because a 
                    certain <i>Mishima</i> keeps destroying cities and leaving
                    children without parents. Or <i>maybe</i> a certain 
                    <i>corporation</i> owned by said Mishima is creating child
                    soldiers. But of course, I wouldn't want to badmouth anybody...
                    *wink wink*
                </p>

                <p style="margin-bottom: 60px;">
                    So now I'm back at it for the eighth year in a row. Surely
                    this will be my last one.
                </p>

                    <p>
                        At least it seems like it'll be an easier one this year. No
                        Heihachi, no guys with spiked bats, no Final Fantasy
                        characters (I don't even know who invited that 'Noctis guy').
                        <br><br>

                    <p>
                        I'd say the only real threat this year is that Steve guy. You know, the
                        the boxer? He's alwas been a pain in my side. It's like he 
                        just counters everything I throw at him. It's like he was
                        made in a lab or something. Idk. Like I'm happy he's getting
                        stronger and I have fun fighting him, but at the end of
                        the day I still have money to make. I don't even know what
                        he needs the money for. I never see this guy buy anything
                        except for like 1 outfit every year. I think he was entering
                        cause of his mom or something? I don't really know with this guy.
                    </p>

                </div>
                <p>
                    Part of me has a feeling that this might be the last tournament
                    they're gonna do. Like I said, Heihachi is dead, his son
                    isn't exactly doing a bang up job, and <i>his son</i>
                    doesn't seem to want anything to do with the family anymore.
                    Can't say I blame the guy. Jin once told me that 
                    Heihachi one tied him, his dad, and his grandfather to a 
                    freaking rocket. Like jeez that family needs counceling.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Also the prizing for this year isn't even just money.
                    Whoever wins just becomes the owner of the Mishima Zaibatsu
                    (the guys that run the tournament). And I can tell you right
                    now that I wouldn't be running tournaments if I were the owner.
                    So it might just end with me.
                </p>
                <p style="margin-top: 60px;">
                    Wish me luck. It's not like I need it but it'd still be nice
