                    Function meets style with the Qanba Obsidian 2. Both 
                    designed and tested by fighting game e-athletes for over a 
                    decade, Qanba joysticks are the superior choice for leveling 
                    up your game. With a stunning exterior built-in 
                    tournament-grade components, the Obsidian 2 is a favorite 
                    by members of the fighting game community and top e-athletes 
                    alike. The Obsidian 2 is equipped with Sanwa Denshi joystick 
                    and pushbuttons for the most authentic Japanese arcade style 
                    experience, wherever you play. Universally agreed as the 
                    standard for tournament play, the Sanwa Denshi components 
                    ensure the highest precision so nothing inhibits your 
                    A-game.

                    lightweight and durable. The Drone 2 is QANBA's answer to 
                    the playersâ€™ calls for a cost-effective joystick that 
                    performs high-end, making it an excellent choice for both 
                    first-time buyers and traveling veterans.

                    The tournament ready Titan joystick from Qanba will help 
                    you take your gaming skill to the next level. The Titan 
                    joystick is compatible with the PlayStation 5, 
                    PlayStation 4, and PC and connects via wired USB. The Titan 
                    joystick is equipped with Sanwa buttons and a Sanwa lever. 
                    The spacing between the lever and the buttons has been 
                    extended for players who need more space and comfort. The 
                    smaller size also makes transporting the Titan joystick easy 
                    to pack in backpacks or luggage.
