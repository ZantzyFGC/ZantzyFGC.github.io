                    The <b>fighting game community</b>, often abbreviated to <b>FGC</b>, is a 
                    collective of video gamers who play fighting games such as 
                    <i>Marvel vs. Capcom, Mortal Kombat, Soulcalibur, Street 
                    Fighter, Guilty Gear, The King of Fighters, Blazblue, 
                    Super Smash Bros., Tekken, Mobile Suit Gundam: Extreme Vs., 
                    Dead or Alive, Samurai Shodown, Shadow Fight 2</i> and many 
                    others. The fighting game community started out small in the 
                    late 1990s and throughout the 2000s referred to as the 
                    grassroots era, but it has grown to a larger scale in the 
                    2010s, with many tournaments being held around the world. 
                    This is predominantly due to the rise of esports, online 
                    gaming, and digitized viewing habits on live streaming 
                    sites such as Twitch.

                    The game <i>Street Fighter II: The World Warrior</i> was a huge 
                    success when it was released in 1991 and is regarded as one 
                    of the most influential video games of all time. It refined 
                    and popularized the fighting game genre and introduced many 
                    now-staples of the genre, such as combos and character 
                    selection but most notably, it allowed players to directly 
                    compete by fighting against each other in the game, while 
                    earlier games primarily had players compete by comparing 
                    highscores. During the mid-1990s, a <i>Street Fighter II</i> 
                    tournament scene had coalesced in various cities across 
                    the United States. Highly competitive communities formed 
                    naturally in Chinatown Fair in New York City, Super Just 
                    Games in the Chicago area, and the Golfland arcade halls 
                    in Sunnyvale and Stanton, California. Players had also 
                    began finding each other and discussing strategies on 
                    message boards via the internet. In 1996, the first 
                    nation-wide fighting game tournament was held in the 
                    form of B3: Battle by the Bay. This tournament was 
                    conceived in order to quell debate over who was the best 
                    <i>Street Fighter</i> player in the country, but also attracted 
                    international competitors.

                    In early 2000, a forum was created called Shoryuken.com 
                    which was named after the iconic <i>Street Fighter</i> attack. 
                    The site became the main go to forum for many fighting 
                    game competitors and it quickly attracted the community 
                    to create major tournaments to gather the best players from 
                    around the country. One of the most major tournaments that 
                    gathers players from around the world is called The 
                    Evolution Championship Series (EVO). The rise in competitive 
                    video game genres during the 2000s became a phenomenon 
                    known as Esports. The early 2000s also saw the rise in 
                    online gaming as <i>Mortal Kombat: Deception, Dead or Alive 
                    Ultimate</i>, and the Xbox version of <i>Street Fighter Anniversary 
                    Collection</i> became the first fighting games to offer online 
                    multiplayer, which also contributed in growing the 
                    community. In middle of the 2000s Capcom’s popularity began 
                    to fade due to lack of new fighting games, the overall sales 
                    of the genre, and some problems within the community; though 
                    it could be noted that the lack of a new street fighter game 
                    created a popularity vacuum, in which games like <i>Tekken, 
                    Soulcaliber, Dead or Alive, and Virtua Fighter</i> increased 
                    in popularity.

                    It was not until 2007 that a new spark arose in the 
                    fighting game community. <i>Dead or Alive 4</i> was included in 
                    the Championship Gaming Series in 2007 and 2008. It was 
                    the only fighting game included in the esport league and 
                    was operated and fully broadcast by DirecTV in association 
                    with British Sky Broadcasting (BSkyB) and STAR TV, making 
                    <i>Dead or Alive 4</i> the first fighting game to have a televised 
                    esport event. After nearly a decade without an entry, 
                    Capcom announced the continuation of the mainline <i>Street 
                    Fighter</i> series with the development of <i>Street Fighter IV</i>, 
                    following up <i>Street Fighter III: Third Strike</i> after eight 
                    years. The game was acclaimed by major game review outlets 
                    and is seen as the chief catalyst of the revival of the 
                    FGC. By rejuvenating the popularity of fighting games, its 
                    release also created an influx of new players into the 
                    community, increasing the number of competitors and 
                    introducing legendary players such as SonicFox, Momochi, 
                    Snake Eyez, GamerBee, and others.

                        After the success of <i>Street Fighter IV</i>, new fighting games 
                        began being developed and the FGC expanded with more 
                        tournaments. The tournaments even started being 
                        live-streamed with Twitch so many people can view the 
                        tournaments. There are also sponsor-ships from franchises 
                        like Evil Geniuses, Broken Tier, and Mad Catz, which pays 
                        players for free advertisement.

                        Despite the rise of other competitive video game genres, 
                        many members of the FGC have rejected the label of “Esports” 
                        on their community.
                    </p>
                <p>
                    The overall size of the community remains a very small 
                    proportion of the fighting game market overall. Some of the 
                    genre’s biggest selling games, such as <i>Tekken 5, Super 
                    Smash Bros. Ultimate and Mortal Kombat X</i>, have sold in 
                    excess of 5 million copies. In contrast, the same games 
                    might only attract 1,000–2,000 entrants at a large 
                    tournament. Typically some 20–30% of players fight online.

                    In recent years, the FGC has been rocked by numerous sexual 
                    assault and harassment allegations involving legal 
                    proceedings, including those of some of the FGC’s most 
                    prominent organizers like EVO co-founder and organizer, 
                    Joey Cuellar, and some of the FGC’s most prominent Smash 
                    Bros players.

                    In 2020, the Japan Fighting Game Publishers Roundtable was 
                    announced where game development heads for <i>Dead or Alive, 
                    Fighting EX Layer, Guilty Gear, Samurai Showdown, 
                    Soulcalibur, Street Fighter and Tekken</i>, came together for a 
                    livestreamed discussion on the future of fighting games and 
                    other topics. The event later followed with more developers, 
                    such as the developers for <i> King of Fighters</i> in 2021, and 
                    <i>Virtua Fighter</i> in 2022.

                    Hundreds of online and offline tournaments are held 
                    worldwide every year, ranging anywhere in size from less 
                    than ten to over 10,000 entrants, depending on the location, 
                    entry fee, prize pot, and game or range of games available. 
                    Tournaments are typically run through grassroots community
